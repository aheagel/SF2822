    The user model has 123 constraints and 376 variables
    with 1498 Jacobian elements, 374 of which are nonlinear.
    The Hessian of the Lagrangian has 374 elements on the diagonal,
    1870 elements below the diagonal, and 374 nonlinear variables.
 
    The post-triangular part of the model has 2 constraints and variables.
 
    Preprocessed model has 121 constraints and 374 variables
    with 748 Jacobian elements, 0 of which are nonlinear.
 
 ** Optimal solution. Reduced gradient less than tolerance.
    Tolerance is relaxed due to large 2nd derivatives.
